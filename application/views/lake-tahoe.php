          <p><b>What are the things to do here?</b></p>
          <p>Well, if you plan to come here, then we do bring to you the list of the places that you do need to visit and also create some of the best moments with your loved ones.</p>
          <p><b>1. Visit the Emerald Bay State Park</b></p>
          <p>Anyone wishing to enjoy Lake Tahoe's splendour must visit this state park, which was carved by moving glaciers millions of years ago. This entrance on Lake Tahoe's southwest side, which is protected by tall trees, is well-known for its vibrant granite cliffs and breathtaking vistas. The Emerald Bay Lookout, the park's crown gem, may be found by following Highway 89 south from Tahoe City (20 miles) or north from South Lake Tahoe (10 miles).</p>
          <p><b>2.Kings Beach State Recreation Area</b></p>
          <p>Stretching along Lake Tahoe's northern shore, this beach is one of the largest in the area. The nearly 13-acre park – which encompasses a fair amount of shoreline on the northern edge of Lake Tahoe – is ideal for swimming, sunbathing and boating; plus, there is also a picnic area and a playground, as well as restroom facilities.</p>
          <p><b>3.Palisades Tahoe</b></p>
          <p>Palisades Tahoe is considered one of the world's finest ski resorts thanks to its nearly 6,000 acres of terrain and its advanced lift system. Plus, it sees more than 400 inches of annual snowfall, meaning Palisades operates the longest ski and snowboard season in Lake Tahoe. It's no wonder the resort was chosen to host the 1960 Winter Olympics.</p>
