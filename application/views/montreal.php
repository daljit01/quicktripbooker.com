          <h2>About Montreal- the liveliest city of the world </h2>
            <p>In the fall, Montreal raises their game. It's a city that understands how to appreciate the final rays of summer while welcoming the approach of fall. Whether you're a visitor or a native, this list of must-do activities in Montreal is a must-have on your to-do list. It includes the city's most famous landmarks, museums, restaurants, and pubs, as well as the top apple-picking spots.
</p>
<p><b>What to do here?</b></p>
<p>We give you the list of the places that you need to visit-</p>
         
     
         <p><b>1. Hang out on rue Wellington in Verdun</b></p>
         <p>There is no denying Rue Wellington's hip ness because it is surrounded by two of the top restaurants in the cityâ€”one of the best new eateries as well. The trendiest crowd in the city can be found when you combine it with some top-notch cocktail bars, outstanding brunch venues, some of the tastiest sandwiches in town, and even a sandy urban beach.</p>
         <p><b>2. Join the brunch bunch</b></p>
         <p>Brunch is hard to top, but when had on a sunny terrace, everything seems right with the world. In these places, outdoor eating season is strongly cherished, so visit as many terrasses as you can. Because of the breathtaking views, among of our favourite places to have brunch outside include Terrasse Nelligan and Hotel William Gray.</p>
         <p><b>3. Take a hot air balloon ride</b></p>
         <p>These balloon trips, which are available at Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, 35 minutes from Montreal, allow you to see for kilometres in all directions until mid-October. It's an once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, especially in the fall when the foliage is at its best.</p>
