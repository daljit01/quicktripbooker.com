          <h2>Know more of Calgary</h2>
          <p>Calgary has never shed its "Cowtown" moniker, despite being the largest city in Alberta, the country's oil capital, and one of the most significant economic and financial hubs in North America. This name, which alludes to the area's lengthy history as the hub of a huge cattle-rearing region, has in reality been extremely valuable to tourist marketers since it evokes romantic notions of cowboys, cattle drives, and an untamed Wild West.</p>
          <p><b>Things to do here:</b></p>
          <p><b>1.Visit during the Calgary Stampede</b></p>
          <p>The 10-day Calgary Stampede, which has origins dating back to the 1880s and is the summertime high point of Calgary, Alberta, solidifies this city's status as Canada's "Stampede City." This well-known rodeo, dubbed "The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth," takes place in July and features a variety of cowboy- and rodeo-themed performances and displays.</p>
          <p><b>2.Take a Day Trip to Banff & Lake Louise</b></p>
          <p>Banff National Park and the town of Banff are unquestionably one of Canada's most picturesque locations, and they are the ideal day excursion from Calgary. While there are several ways to go from Calgary to Banff, having a car—either your own or a rental—might be the ideal choice if you like taking your time and having the freedom to stop whenever the need strikes.</p>
          <p><b>3.Learn about Calgary's Past at Heritage Park</b></p>
          <p>With a large number of historically accurate structures that have been faithfully recreated and engaging costumed interpreters from four distinct eras, Calgary's Heritage Park is a typical pioneering hamlet. A feature of a visit is riding the ancient steam engine that offers transportation around the park, in addition to displays and structures that range from an 1860 fur-trading fort to a 1930s town centre.</p>
          <p><b>4.See the Views from Calgary Tower</b></p>
          <p>A glass-floored observation platform with a rotating restaurant is located at the top of the Calgary Tower, where visitors may experience the exhilarating feeling of being 191 metres above the city in one of its iconic structures.</p>
